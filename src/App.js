                React provides two standard ways to grab values 
                from <strong>form</strong> elements. 
                The first method is to implement what are called <strong>controlled
                components</strong> and the second is to use <strong>React's 
                Ref</strong> property (the general rule of thumb is 
                to <strong>avoid it</strong>).<br />                
                <strong>Controled Elements</strong> (<em>an input

                React provides two standard ways to grab values 
                from <strong>form</strong> elements. 
                The first method is to implement what are called <strong>controlled
                components</strong> and the second is to use <strong>React's 
                Ref</strong> property;<br />
                Using <strong>Ref</strong> property of an element 
                (<em>an easier way to grab values from a form</em>), 
                remember that the inputs are DOM elements. <strong>DON'T use them 
                on production</strong> (see babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types);<br />
                Using <strong>Ref</strong> to get a reference to specific component 
                (see <em>ContactSelect</em> component). There are three occasions 
                where you can use it (bc you have no other choice):<br />
                - Managing focus, text selection, or media playback;<br />
                - Integrating with third-party DOM libraries;<br />
                - Triggering imperative animations;<br />      
                <strong>PropTypes</strong> <em>(<strong>React.PropTypes</strong> has 
                moved into a different package since <strong>React v15.5</strong>,
                use the prop-types library instead), see ContactThankYou</em> component;
