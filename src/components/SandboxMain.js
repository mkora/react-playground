          Using <strong>Ref</strong> property of an element 
          (<em>an easier way to grab values from a form</em>), 
          remember that the inputs are DOM elements. <strong>DON'T use them

          Using <strong>Ref</strong> to get a reference to specific component 
          (see <em>ContactSelect</em> component). There are three occasions 
          where you can use it (bc you have no other choice):<br />
          - Managing focus, text selection, or media playback;<br />
          - Integrating with third-party DOM libraries;<br />
